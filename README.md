# ostep-vectors
Potential solution to homework question #14:8 from the [OSTEP book](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) in the form of a command line librarian program. 

## todo:
1. Get initial memory allocation and initalisation working and passing in _valgrind_ [X].
2. Create procedures for adding new entries to the struct, reallocating the memory in the vector array and initalising this new entry within each element [].
3. Add command line parsing [].
4. Add tests, fix bugs [].
